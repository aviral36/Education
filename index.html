        <p>I believe in gaining knowledge from wide range of sources.<br>
Therefore, beginning from my childhood; I have changed more schools than my profile picture.<br>
So technically, I list the ones I remember one by one.<br>
<em>(Whoa! I remember them all)</em></p>

<a id="1-st-peters-academy-allahabad" class="anchor" href="#1-st-peters-academy-allahabad" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>#1. St. Peter’s Academy, Allahabad.</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>I really don’t have good memories of this place since I cried the entire year I studied here. All I remember that it was a small school with really nice little classrooms; and a BAD, REALLY BAD security man who did not allow my mom to sit with me in class; and that's what made me cry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>St. Peter’s Academy is a primary school in Allahabad,UP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay, this was huge! I hadn’t seen such a sprawling campus of a school in my entire little 4 year long life that I had lived. I remember every single bit of this place; and being a boys convent school, I remember that we did get strict punishments too.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>BHS is a convent school in Allahabad, UP. It is well known for it's notable alumni including actor Amitabh Bachchan; and is one of the most reputed schools of India.</p>

<a id="3-ryan-international-school-bangalore" class="anchor" href="#3-ryan-international-school-bangalore" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>#3. Ryan International School, Bangalore.</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>I spent my early teenage years in Bangalore. This school, being my second home for my 5 year stay in Bangalore, has a special memory attached to it. I have made amazing friends, got to know new cultures, ate all kinds of delicacies <em>(from other's lunch boxes, legally)</em> and most importantly, developed my interest in Science. Maybe because of the teachers that taught us, I really started loving science.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ryan International is a private school in like....almost all the cities in India!<br>
<em>(McDonalds, Did you read this?)</em><br>
Yeah, almost every inhabitable place in India consists of a Ryan School. <em>(I am serious McD.)</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>An example of what I said in my last few lines of #3- Delhi is inhabited by humans, so it has a Ryan. Not one, but three. <code>_Considering the National Capital Region, there are 10.   Not funny.   A day will come the earthlings will be replaced by Ryanites._</code><br>
All apart, This, yes, the one I studied in; is a really nice school. Awesome teachers and amazing classmates. 
Undoubtedly, this place has created my personality; made me what I am today. <em>(Although it is an entirely different story that I actually am nothing as of today)</em>
I have made friends, good friends, really good friends, and special friend.  <em>(Oh, That? I rate my friends and keep them into different categories, a highly evolved condition of selection sort).</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is what I am as of now. An undergrad, who recently cleared his JEE Mains and JEE Advanced, got into DTU to continue his study and some research on computer architecture and computer algorithms , but ended up doing this   --   creating a webpage on GitHub.
Yes, I represent a typical B.Tech undergrad of India. </p>
