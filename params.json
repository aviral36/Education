I remember them all)_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# #1. St. Peter’s Academy, Allahabad. \r\n\r\n> I really don’t have good memories of this place since I cried the entire year I studied here. All I remember that it was a small school with really nice little classrooms; and a BAD, REALLY BAD security man who did not allow my mom to sit with me in class; and that's what made me cry.\r\n> >  St. Peter’s Academy is a primary school in Allahabad,UP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# #2. Boy’s High School Annexe, Allahabad.\r\n\r\n> Okay, this was huge! I hadn’t seen such a sprawling campus of a school in my entire little 4 year long life that I had lived. I remember every single bit of this place; and being a boys convent school, I remember that we did get strict punishments too.  \r\n> > BHS is a convent school in Allahabad, UP. It is well known for it's notable alumni including actor Amitabh Bachchan; and is one of the most reputed schools of India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# #3. Ryan International School, Bangalore.\r\n\r\n> I spent my early teenage years in Bangalore. This school, being my second home for my 5 year stay in Bangalore, has a special memory attached to it. I have made amazing friends, got to know new cultures, ate all kinds of delicacies _(from other's lunch boxes, legally)_ and most importantly, developed my interest in Science. Maybe because of the teachers that taught us, I really started loving science.   \r\n> > Ryan International is a private school in like....180 cities of India!    \r\n> > _(McDonalds, Did you read this?)_   \r\n> > Yeah, almost every inhabitable place in India consists of a Ryan School. _(I am serious McD.)_\r\n\r\n\r\n# #4. Ryan International School, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi. \r\n\r\n> An example of what I said in my last few lines of #3- Delhi is inhabited by humans, so it has a Ryan. Not one, but three. `_Considering the National Capital Region, there are 10.   Not funny.   A day will come the earthlings will be replaced by Ryanites._ `  \r\n> All apart, This, yes, the one I studied in; is a really nice school. Awesome teachers and amazing classmates. \r\n> Undoubtedly, this place has created my personality; made me what I am today. _(Although it is an entirely different story that I actually am nothing as of today)_\r\n> I have made friends, good friends, really good friends, and special friend.  _(Oh, That? I rate my friends and keep them into different categories, a highly evolved condition of selection sort)._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# #5. Delhi Technological University, Delhi.\r\n\r\n> This is what I am as of now. An undergrad, who recently cleared his JEE Mains and JEE Advanced, got into DTU to continue his study and some research on computer architecture and computer algorithms , but ended up doing this   --   creating a webpage on GitHub.\r\n>Yes, I represent a typical B.Tech undergrad of India. \r\n\r\n\r\nThank You for reading!\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\nThis page is maintained by [aviral36](http://plus.google.com/+AviralSharmaHome).  \r\nA GitHub project under MIT License.\r\n***\r\n",
